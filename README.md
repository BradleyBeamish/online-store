# Online-Store

This project is an e-commerce platform that emulates an online store, enabling users to seamlessly engage in buying and selling a diverse range of items. Developed utilizing the robust MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, along with Tailwind CSS for styling and Vite for a lightning-fast development experience. This project emphasizes a strong focus on backend implementation while maintaining essential frontend functionalities.

## Technologies Utilized:

-   **Backend**: Express.js and Node.js provide a performant and secure server-side foundation, enabling efficient API development and data management.
-   **Database:** MongoDB, a versatile NoSQL database, ensures flexible data storage and retrieval, accommodating complex item structures and relationships.
-   **Frontend:** React.js, a powerful JavaScript library, enables the creation of interactive and dynamic user interfaces, enhancing user engagement and interactivity.
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, offers a comprehensive set of pre-built components and styling utilities, facilitating efficient UI development.
-   **Development Experience:** Vite, a fast and modern build tool, optimizes the development workflow, providing rapid reloads and an enjoyable development experience.

## Features:

### User Authentication:

This code provides user authentication functionality for your website. The /register route allows users to create a new account by providing a username, email, and password. The password is securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database. The /login route allows users to log in by providing their email and password. User provided credentials are verified by comparing the hashed password with the stored hashed password. If the credentials are valid, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated and returned to the client, along with the user's ID.

### Viewing all Listings:

The homepage showcases a comprehensive collection of listings generated by multiple users. The most recent listings are positioned at the forefront and gradually descend as subsequent listings are added. Each individual listing incorporates a pop up that provides a comprehensive overview, inclusive of pertinent details, accompanied by a contact button. At the top of the page, a user-friendly search bar can be found which provides instant and seamless search results of listings sorted by their title, with real-time modifications to the results.

### Creating Listings:

Upon successful user authentication, individuals will be granted the privilege to generate listings. They will have the capability to input information regarding the listing they are creating (ex. Title, description, image url, etc), with their respective username and email automatically associated with each entry. After form submission, the data will be sent to the backend, where it will be stored within the database. As a result, the listing will be accessible on both the homepage and the user's profile section.

### Profile:

When navigating to the profile tab, a hook will be utilized to fetch the username and retrieve all the listings created by the currently logged-in user. This approach ensures seamless retrieval of the necessary information. Users will be provided with a clear and concise overview of their listings, accompanied by a user-friendly delete button for each entry, enabling them to easily manage their listings.

### Contact:

When users are logged into the system, they gain the ability to contact listing owners. This involves filling in email details, including the desired email service (e.g., Gmail), along with the corresponding password. The provided data is securely transmitted to the backend, where nodemailer is utilized. Nodemailer enables the backend to construct, format, and securely send emails by establishing connections with email servers and following established delivery protocols. This streamlined process ensures efficient and reliable communication between users and listing owners while adhering to industry standards and security practices.
