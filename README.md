# Online-Store

This project is an e-commerce platform that emulates an online store, enabling users to buy and sell different items. Developed utilizing the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, along with Tailwind CSS for styling and Vite for a fast development experience. This project emphasizes a strong focus on backend implementation while maintaining essential frontend functionalities.

## Technologies Utilized:

-   **Backend**: Express.js and Node.js provide a performant and secure server-side foundation, enabling API development and data management.
-   **Database:** MongoDB, a NoSQL database, ensures flexible data storage and retrieval.
-   **Frontend:** React.js, a JavaScript library, enables the creation of interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, a CSS framework, offers a set of pre-built components and styling utilities.
-   **Development Experience:** Vite, a fast and modern build tool, optimizes the development workflow.

## Features:

### User Authentication:

In order for a user to use any of the websites features, they must first be logged in. The /register route allows users to create a new account by providing a username, email, and password. The password is securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database. The /login route allows users to log in by providing their email and password. User provided credentials are verified by comparing the hashed password with the stored hashed password. If the credentials are valid, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated and returned to the client, along with the user's ID.

### Viewing all Listings:

The homepage showcases a collection of listings generated by all users. The most recent listings are positioned at the forefront and gradually descend as new listings are added. Each individual listing incorporates a pop up that provides more information for the posting that is selected. At the top of the page, a search bar can be found which provides instant search results of listings sorted by their title, with real-time modifications to the results.

### Creating Listings:

Upon successful user authentication, individuals will be able to create listings. They will have the capability to input information regarding the listing they are creating (ex. Title, description, image url, etc), with their respective username and email automatically associated with each entry. After form submission, the data will be sent to the backend, where it will be stored within the database. As a result, the listing will be accessible on both the homepage and the user's profile section.

### Profile:

When navigating to the profile tab, a hook will be utilized to fetch the username and retrieve all the listings created by the user that is currently logged-in. Users will be provided with a clear overview of their listings, along with a delete button for each entry, enabling them to easily manage their listings.

### Contact:

When users are logged into the system, they gain the ability to contact listing owners. This involves filling in email details, including the desired email service (e.g., Gmail), along with the corresponding password for that service. The provided data is securely transmitted to the backend, where nodemailer is utilized. Nodemailer enables the backend to construct, format, and securely send emails by establishing connections with email servers and following established delivery protocols.
